## Overview
Bee Attack is an interactive and engaging game that uses real-time video processing to create a challenging and fun experience. Player have to fend off bees by using their hand movements, making it not just a visual treat but also physically interactive. The game requires *Opencv* and *Pygame* libraries. 

## Features

1. **Real-time Video Processing**: Uses advanced video processing techniques to detect hand gestures and the position of bees.
2. **Interactive Gameplay (not fully implemented yet)**: Move your hands to shoo away the bees! The faster you move, the more bees you can fend off.
3. **Optimized Performance**: The game processes only 1/10th of the frames to ensure smoother performance without compromising on the gaming experience.
4. **Dynamic Difficulty (not fully implemented yet)**: As you progress, more bees swarm in, testing your agility and reflexes.
5. **Bee Kick Mechanism**: A unique feature where a swift hand movement can 'kick' away bee.
